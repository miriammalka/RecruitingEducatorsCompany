# RecruitingEducatorsCompany
I have a recruiting company called Educators Connect, which specializes in helping educators find jobs, mainly right after graduating. Every day we place many educators in different schools all over New York. In order to conduct data analysis, we want to keep track of our educators and various details about them. I need to know the first name, last name, date of birth, gender, college attended, and title of their degree. Then I need to know how they found out about recruiting company, the date they contacted us, which school we placed them in and the date we found them a job.
